The SZ Regulator or SZ-REG is a simple 5V regulator to power your Game Boy Pocket or Game Boy Color. This power regulator is only compatible with IPS kits and cannot be used with OEM MGB/CGB screens

# Ordering / Customization

*Blank*
A version of the SZ Regulator without any silkscreen/image is available in this github as a gerber. Upload the gerber to a PCB fab (JLCPCB, PCBWay, OSHPark) with a board thickness of at least 1.0mm and in your favorite color.

*Customizable*
If you would like a SZ Regulator with a customized silkscreen image, you can make a request through my Ko-fi.  I will convert the image, place it on the SZ Regulator front, and send you the gerber so that you can order from a PCB fab.
